# nutrientplus
An app that provides its user with the optimal food choices to reach daily nutrient goals.

## Description
Due to the constant stresses of school, work, and everyday life, most do not have the time or wherewithal to track and maintain their daily baseline of nutrients. Without these key nutrients, most do not perform at their best, and this persistent lack of daily nutrient intake results in long term health side effects.

With Nutrient+, we aim to provide the user with an easy and intuitive way to track their nutritional intake. In addition, the app will suggest optimal foods to eat in order to meet and maintain their daily intake goals.
